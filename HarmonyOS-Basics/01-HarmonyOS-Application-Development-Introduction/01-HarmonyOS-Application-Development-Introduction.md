# Core Philosophy

Everything is a service, everything can be shared; higher development efficiency, lower development costs.

Nine major services integrated in HarmonyOS application development:

1. App Gallery Service
2. In-App Purchases
3. Cards
4. Live Windows
5. Huawei Payment Service
6. Accessibility Development Service
7. Map Service
8. Intent Framework
9. Scan Service

These capabilities enable developers to more easily create applications that work seamlessly!

# App Gallery Service

[Store Kit (App Gallery Service)](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/store-kit-guide-V5) helps HarmonyOS NEXT ecosystem partners achieve app and in-app digital product recommendations, distribution, and in-app purchases and transactions. Focusing on developer user growth efficiency improvement and in-app digital product revenue enhancement, Store Kit provides distribution services that reduce user app acquisition time, pop-up update guidance services that improve user app update experience, digital product services that help users purchase digital goods, and In-App-Purchase capabilities, helping developers achieve efficient distribution and monetization.

# In-App Payments

In-app payment service provides convenient in-app payment experience and simple integration process for apps, allowing you to focus on your app's business capabilities and helping your commercial monetization. Your app can implement in-app payments by integrating [IAP Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/iap-kit-guide-V5) to launch the IAP checkout.

# Cards

HarmonyOS applications or AtomicServices are displayed on device desktops in the form of service cards, helping users quickly access and process in-app information. After setting up [service cards](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/formkit-overview-V5), users can see real-time application information on the desktop and perform operations - what you see is what you get.

# Live Windows

[Live Windows](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/app/) service supports applications displaying real-time status information changes of orders or services on key device interfaces, and manages the lifecycle and user interface UI effects of the displayed information.

# Huawei Payment Service

[Payment Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/payment-kit-guide-V5) (Huawei Payment Service) provides convenient, secure, and fast payment methods, opening powerful payment, marketing, and operational capabilities to developers through HarmonyOS system-level interfaces, with convenient and rapid integration. Users can complete purchases of physical goods or services through payments within developers' applications/AtomicServices and display payment results.

# Accessibility Development Service

[Accessibility Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/accessibility-kit-V5) (Accessibility Development Service) provides open capabilities for extension services. Third parties can develop extension services similar to screen readers based on these open capabilities to better serve people with disabilities and accessibility scenarios. For example, using screen reader software, users can "hear" current screen content.

# Map Service

[Map Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/map-kit-guide-V5/) (Map Service) provides developers with powerful and convenient mapping capabilities, helping global developers achieve personalized map presentation, map search, and route planning functions, easily completing map construction work. You can easily integrate map-related functions in HarmonyOS applications/AtomicServices, comprehensively enhancing user experience.

# Intent Framework

[Intents Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/intents-kit-guide-V5/) (Intent Framework Service) is a HarmonyOS-level intent standard system where intents connect business functions within applications/AtomicServices. This service helps developers intelligently distribute business functions within applications/AtomicServices to various system entry points, a process called intelligent distribution. System entry points include: Xiaoyi Dialogue, Xiaoyi Search, Xiaoyi Suggestions, etc.

# Scan Service

[Scan Kit](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/doc/harmonyos-guides-V5/scan-kit-guide-V5/) (Unified Scan Service), as a software-hardware collaborative system-level scanning service, helps developers' applications quickly build code recognition and generation capabilities for various scenarios, as well as scan-to-reach capabilities. Scan Kit applies multiple computer vision technologies and AI algorithm technologies, not only achieving long-distance automatic scanning, but also optimizing recognition for various complex scanning scenarios (such as low light, damage, blur, small angles, curved codes, etc.), improving scan success rates and user experience.
